# NHecutor
YOUR ANTIVIRUS HAS TO BE OFF, OR YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION OR ELSE WeAreDevs_API.dll WILL BE DELETED RENDERING IT USELESS.

The simplest Roblox script executor ever made, perfect for beginners.
To download, go ahead and make a zip copy of the source. the executor will be in NHecutorv1.1. Nothing is needed to run, just press "Attach" and put your code in the text box and click on "Execute".
The "Clear" button will clear the text box.
The side panel contains scripts that are placed in the "scripts" folder for easy access! Do be aware that for your scripts to show up, you need to have restarted the program.
Personal script reccomendation of mine is Infinite Yield FE, simple admin script will basically give you HD Admin with extra steps.
To use it, paste: "loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'))()" into the text box and hit "Execute"

To execute a script instantly upon attachment, place a .txt or a .lua file containing your script in the "autoexec" folder. (This feature has not been tested by me so idk if it works bc i dont use autoexec, be my guest tho.)

From what i know, the code was made by https://www.youtube.com/@NikkkYT. Big thanks!
